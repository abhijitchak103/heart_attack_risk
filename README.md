# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

## About the Dataset - Problem Description
 
The Heart Attack Risk Prediction Dataset (synthetic creation generated using ChatGPT to simulate a realistic experience) serves as a valuable resource for delving into the intricate dynamics of heart health and its predictors. Heart attacks, or myocardial infarctions, continue to be a significant global health issue, necessitating a deeper comprehension of their precursors and potential mitigating factors. This dataset encapsulates a diverse range of attributes including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, exercise patterns, dietary preferences, and more, aiming to elucidate the complex interplay of these variables in determining the likelihood of a heart attack. By employing predictive analytics and machine learning on this dataset, researchers and healthcare professionals can work towards proactive strategies for heart disease prevention and management. The dataset stands as a testament to collective efforts to enhance our understanding of cardiovascular health and pave the way for a healthier future.

This dataset provides a comprehensive array of features relevant to heart health and lifestyle choices, encompassing patient-specific details such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and indicators like diabetes, family history, smoking habits, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, lifestyle factors like exercise hours, dietary habits, stress levels, and sedentary hours are included. Medical aspects comprising previous heart problems, medication usage, and triglyceride levels are considered. Socioeconomic aspects such as income and geographical attributes like country, continent, and hemisphere are incorporated. The dataset, consisting of 8763 records from patients around the globe, culminates in a crucial binary classification feature denoting the presence or absence of a heart attack risk, providing a comprehensive resource for predictive analysis and research in cardiovascular health.
